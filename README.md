Super Mario: The Adventure Quest is a MarioBros-style platformer where players navigate through aseries of obstacles, collect coins, and avoid enemies and hazards. The objective is to reach the endpoint of each level after collecting all available coins, represented by a flag or specific location. The game includes standard platformer mechanics, such as moving left and right, jumping, and interacting with objects in the environment.

The game world is filled with classic platformer elements, including breakable and unbreakable blocks, moving platforms, and hidden passages, adding layers of complexity and exploration to each level. Players must master timing and precision to dodge enemies and hazards, which are strategically placed to challenge their progress. Enemies have unique behaviors, such as patrolling specific areas, following set paths, or actively pursuing the player when in close range. Hazards like fire, spikes, or pits add an extra layer of difficulty, often requiring the player to pause and observe patterns before advancing.
